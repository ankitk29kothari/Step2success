#Flask is light weighted framework here we are creating functions same like python just difference is here we are mapping the function 
#with @app route so we are calling the function from web and return the data to web
#pip install flask
#From Flask we can also create API


#An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another.
#It also contains the terms of this data exchange in the same format ie json,xml.


#We can use get/post any method.In get we are transmitting data with url its not secured but bit easy IE: www.googlemaps/?location_id=12020
#in post we are sending with encapsulation

from flask import Flask, render_template, request,jsonify
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def page():
	return("Hi, web page")
