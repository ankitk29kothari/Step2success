# in last eg we are refresing page to get new content but it will cause to load whole page css and js and cause delay.
# in order to get it real time we are using AJAX.
#AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications
#With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen. 
#In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.

# In AJAX only a part of data is transmiited and change in web page not whole page.
# Only Jquery has capability o change the HTML in run time

# With AJAX you can create real time form validation.
